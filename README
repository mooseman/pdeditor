 This is the start of a very simple Python text editor using curses. 
 Still at around alpha stage.  

 ** Good news! **  Scrolling now works!   Still have to implement 
page-up and page-down, but text now scrolls as expected when 
you get to the bottom of the page.     

 There are still a few scroll bugs though.  When text scrolls off the page 
(e.g. off the top), it is not displayed again when you try to scroll back to it. 
This is in the process of being fixed, using a dictionary that will store the 
line of text.  

 The key-bindings are as follows - 
  
Keystroke 	Action
Home  	        Go to left edge of window.
End  	        Go to right edge of window.
Ctrl-A              Print the contents of the data dictionary  
Ctrl-G 	        Exit the editor.  

 
 As usual, the code is public-domain... "share and enjoy....."  :)
