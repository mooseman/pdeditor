 Two simple public-domain text editors - one in Python and 
 the other in C.  
 
*** STATUS (as at 24th Nov 2010) ***
 Python - beta stage. Scrolling works. Still need to 
 implement page-up and page-down.   
 
 C - alpha.  Scrolling not yet working. Still need to 
 implement page-up and page-down.  

 The key-bindings are as follows (Python editor) - 
  
Keystroke 	Action
Home  	    Go to left edge of window.
End  	    Go to right edge of window.
Ctrl-A      Print the contents of the data dictionary  
Ctrl-G 	    Exit the editor.  
F2          Insert line 
F3          Delete line 


 As usual, the code is public-domain... "share and enjoy....."  :)
