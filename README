 This is the start of a very simple Python text editor using curses. 
 Still at around alpha stage.  

 ** Good news! **  Scrolling now works!   Still have to implement 
page-up and page-down, but text now scrolls as expected when 
you get to the bottom of the page.     

 The key-bindings are as follows - 
  
Keystroke 	Action
Home  	        Go to left edge of window.
End  	        Go to right edge of window.
Control-G 	Exit the editor.  

 
 As usual, the code is public-domain... "share and enjoy....."  :)
