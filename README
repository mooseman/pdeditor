 This is a very simple Python text editor using curses. 
 It is now at beta stage.  

 ** Good news! **  Scrolling now works perfectly!  Still have to implement 
page-up and page-down, but text now scrolls as expected when 
you scroll at the top or bottom of the page.     

 The key-bindings are as follows - 
  
Keystroke 	Action
Home  	        Go to left edge of window.
End  	        Go to right edge of window.
Ctrl-A              Print the contents of the data dictionary  
Ctrl-G 	        Exit the editor.  

F2                   Insert line 
F3                   Delete line 



 As usual, the code is public-domain... "share and enjoy....."  :)
