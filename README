 This is the start of a very simple Python text editor using curses. 
 Still very pre-alpha. At present, it is just a very simple textpad object. 
 It will soon be developed further.     

 The key-bindings ( from the "curses" page of the Python docs - ) 
 http://docs.python.org/library/curses.html -  
  
Keystroke 	Action
Control-A 	Go to left edge of window.
Control-B 	Cursor left, wrapping to previous line if appropriate.
Control-D 	Delete character under cursor.
Control-E 	Go to right edge (stripspaces off) or end of line (stripspaces on).
Control-F 	Cursor right, wrapping to next line when appropriate.
Control-G 	Terminate, returning the window contents.
Control-H 	Delete character backward.
Control-J 	Terminate if the window is 1 line, otherwise insert newline.
Control-K 	If line is blank, delete it, otherwise clear to end of line.
Control-L 	Refresh screen.
Control-N 	Cursor down; move down one line.
Control-O 	Insert a blank line at cursor location.
Control-P 	Cursor up; move up one line.

Note - To quit the editor, type Control-G twice.    
 
 As usual, the code is public-domain... "share and enjoy....."  :)
